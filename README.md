# Approov Service for Volley

A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-android-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`Volley`](https://developer.android.com/training/volley) for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

Please see the [Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-android-java-volley) for instructions on its use.
